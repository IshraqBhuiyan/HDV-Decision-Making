      <p> Your name is Ronald McDonald and you are a pilot. Today you are the Captain of Disunited Airlines Flight 91 from New York to Florida.</p>
      Here is the story of one fateful day for you.

      Heavy snow temporarily closed the airport, but now it's finally open again.
      You really want to get out of this frozen hell and be back under the warm Florida Sun.
      You haven't seen your family in so long too. You'd really like to get back as fast as possible.
      It's time to <turn to="cockpit">board</turn> your airplane.

    </page>

    <page id="cockpit">
      <center><img src="images/737Cockpit.jpg" height="250"></img></center>
      You arrive in the cockpit of the Boeing 737 assigned to you with your copilot.<br>
      You begin the preflight <show paragraph="checks">checkist</show>.

      <paragraph id="checks">
        You: Engines?<br>
        Copilot: Check.<br>
        You: Fuel?<br />
        Copilot: Check.<br />
        You: Tire Pressure?<br />
        Copilot: Check.<br /><br />
        Have they <show paragraph="deicing">deiced</show> the plane yet?
      </paragraph>

      <paragraph id="deicing">
        It seems that the airport deicing crew is tending to it right now. It should be done within 15 to 20 minutes.
        <br /><br />
        The weather outside is gradually worsening. If you don't take off soon, you may very well get grounded again.
        you really want to get back to Florida and have some time with my family before your next flight.
        You rarely see them nowadays because of the back to back flights. The passengers are also extremely tired and anxious.
        You don't want to be the one telling them you can't take off and then deal with their complaints.

      <p>
        Air traffic control has given you the clearance to taxi to the runway.
        Unfortunately, because of weather conditions and cleanup, only one runway is open.
        Ahead of you there are many other planes waiting to take off.
        It will take a while to get clearance for takeoff.
      </p>

      <p>
        After 40 minutes of waiting, you copilot turns to you and says,<br />
        "Hey Cap, that sure is a lot of snow and ice that's built up on our wings.
        You sure you don't want to turn back for another deicing?"<br />
      </p>

      <p>
        Looking at the wings, you see that there is indeed snow piled up on the wings,
        and according to standard procedure, you should be turning back for a deicing in
        order to ensure the snow doesn't affect the lift the wings give.
      </p>

      <p>
        You can let Air Traffic Control know and turn back to deice, which is standard procedure and the safest option.
        But you also really want to get out of here ASAP. The sooner you take off, the sooner you can
        fly above the storm clouds and not worry about this crappy weather anymore. The snow on the wings
        is a problem, but perhaps a deicing isn't necessary to melt it. There's another jet in front of you,
        and if you go a little closer to it, the heat from its jet engines should melt the snow on your wings, right?
        This isn't standard procedure, but it may just work. Also, the passengers are getting more and more frustrated
        the more time it takes to get into the air. The faster you get in the air, the less likely you are to deal with them.
        Angry passengers are truly frightening, after all!<br />
        So what do you do: Do you follow standard procedure and <show paragraph="turnback" id="besafe">turn back</show> for
        a deicing, or do you try to use the heat from the jet in front of you to deice and <show paragraph="continue" id="bedumb">continue</show>?
      </p>

      <paragraph id="turnback">
        {{story.disable('bedumb');}}
        {{story.disable('besafe');}}
        You notify air traffic control that you need another deicing and turn your airplane back around.
        <turn to="goodEnding">Next</turn>
      </paragraph>

      <paragraph id="continue">
        {{story.disable('bedumb');}}
        {{story.disable('besafe');}}
        You maneuver your plane a little closer to the jet in front of you, in hopes of using its heat to melt the snow.
        You wait in queue to take off from the runway as you do this.
        <turn to="takeoff">Next</turn>

      <p>
        Finally, you have clearance to take off from Air Traffic Control.<br />
        You ready for takeoff. You tell your copilot to push the throttle with you.<br />
        You hear the engines whine as they spool up and the plane lurches forward, gaining speed.<br />
        Looking at the instrument panel, your copilot says,<br />
        "Oh god, this doesn't look right."<br />
        Expecting nothing, you glance the panel from the corner of your eye, and although you didn't really
        look at it, you don't think anything is wrong. <br />
        Do you <show paragraph="ignore" id="1"> ignore</show> your copilot's concerns or <show paragraph="check" id="2">check</show>?
      </p>

      <paragraph id="ignore">
        {{story.disable('1');}}
        {{story.disable('2');}}
        <p>
          You say to your copilot,<br />
          "Nah, it's fine. Don't worry about it."<br />
          Your copilot, in a softer and harder to hear tone says,<br />
          "I don't think it's right. Ehh, maybe it is? I don't know. I don't think so."<br />
          Do you <show paragraph="ignoreAgain" id="3">ignore</show> his concerns again, or do you <show paragraph="check" id='4'>check</show>?
        </p>
      </paragraph>

      <paragraph id="ignoreAgain">
        {{story.disable('3');}}
        {{story.disable('4');}}
        <p>
          "It's alright" you say to your copilot and continue. <br />
          The trip over the runway is unusually rocky and uncomfortable as the airplane picks up speed.<br />
          The airplane reaches the necessary speed and finally starts lifting off, slowly ascending.<br />
          <turn to="badEnding">Next</turn>
        </p>
      </paragraph>

      <paragraph id="check">
        {{story.disable('1');}}
        {{story.disable('2');}}
        {{story.disable('3');}}
        {{story.disable('4');}}
        <p>
          You decide to listen to your copilot and give the instrument panel a look.
          Looking at it, the readings really do look weird. Quickly, you slow down the airplane
          in order to stop it from taking off. You notify Air Traffic Control something is wrong,
          and turn your airplane around.<br />

        Good job!<br />
        You turned around, following standard procedures, and didn't ignore your copilot completely!
        Your plane was thoroughly deiced, and although it was delayed even further and you had to face the onslaught
        of the angry passengers, you made the responsible decision! During the deicing, you also discover an equipment failure
        due to you not turning on the airplane deicing, causing some of the sensors to behave improperly. Your actions have
        saved you, your crew and the passengers from a terrible potential accident. You should be proud of yourself!

        The airplane ascends a few hundred feet. You're relieved you're finally in the air. Now you can be home soon.<br />
        All of a sudden after a few seconds after takeoff, the stick shaker and alarm go off, indicating that the airplane is in danger of stalling.<br />
        You and your copilot try to get the airplane to start climbing and to get out of the stall.<br />
        But despite your efforts, you can't prevent it. The airplane starts stalling and falling!<br />
        There's nothing you can do! Your airplane continues falling and crashes into a bridge below.<br />
        You, everyone on board, and a few motorists unfortunate to be on the bridge die and many other motorists on the bridge are injured.<br />
        The decisions you have made throughout this flight, such as ignoring standard procedures and your copilot, have lead to this unfortunate accident.<br />
        Now you won't even be able to get back under that warm Florida sun!

      The Air Florida Flight 90 incident was the basis for the story of this game. On January 13, 1982, a Boeing 737-200 crashed into the 14th Street Bridge tragically killing 74 of the 79
      people on board and an additional 4 motorists on the ground. The cause of the accident was pilot error as determined by the National Transportation Safety Board. The pilots failed to switch
      on the engine's internal ice protection systems during ground operation and takeoff. As a result, ice had built up to a dangerous level on the wings of the aircraft. To make the situation worse,
      during takeoff, the captain failed to take the input of his copilot when the copilot called to anomalous engine instrument readings and abort takeoff. This showed
      a lack of proper CPM on the part of the crew which became part of pilot training after this incident.  The pressure to get out of the snowstorm at Washington National Airport and head towards warmer weather in Florida also probably contributed
      to the captain's decision to takeoff despite the abnormalities noted by the copilot. As a result of the mentioned factors, shortly after takeoff, the nose of the 737 pitched sharply up and the plane lost altitude and crashed.<br/>
